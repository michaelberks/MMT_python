Aim here is to generate a set of functions that will automatically generate sectoral
balance charts for a range of countries. Ultimately it would be nice to have these in 
a common interface with all the messy country specific bits hidden in wrapper classes.
I'd guess the most sensible output would be matplots exported to pngs, but we could
think of other ways of display the data.
Some sample Jupyter notebooks for interactive teaching would also be great.
